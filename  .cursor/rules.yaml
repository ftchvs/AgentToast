rules:
  - name: Agent Setup
    content: |
      - Agents should extend `openai.agent.Agent` and define tools inline.
      - Use `plan_and_act()` only when needed.

  - name: Tools
    content: |
      - Define tools with a simple Pydantic input schema and a run() method.
      - Keep tool functions under 50 lines.

  - name: Code Style
    content: |
      - Use type hints.
      - Keep each file under 200 lines for readability.
      - Add basic docstrings.

  - name: File Structure
    content: |
      - Use `/agents` for agent classes, `/tools` for tools.
      - Optional: `/main.py` to run the agent.
