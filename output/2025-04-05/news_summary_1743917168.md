## Summary

The stock market has experienced a tumultuous period, with the Dow tumbling 2,200 points as bonds rally in response to China's retaliation against Trump's tariffs. This move has escalated tensions and raised concerns about a potential trade war's impact on the global economy. Meanwhile, the White House's efforts to secure a deal for TikTok were thwarted by these tariffs, prolonging the battle over the app's fate in the U.S.

In the digital payment sphere, Zelle announced the shutdown of its standalone mobile app, though the service will continue through banking apps.
